faq:

- quetion: What is the relationship between Svenir and Before It Breaks Club?
  answer: |
    Svenir is the technology that allows geolocated minting of NFTs. 

    Before It Breaks Club is an NFT project that leverages the Svenir technology 
    so people can only mint the NFTs when they are in the location.
- quetion: Does Svenir and Before It Breaks Club have a roadmap?
  answer: |
    Knowledge and wisdom is not a destination, it is a direction. The direction is to launch in every city of the world.

    This journey will take us to places and situations we might have not considered yet. The applications of the Svenir 
    technology and the BIBC project will be always aligned with our mission and vision. History will be kind to us for we intend to write it.
- quetion: How do I collect the NFTs from Before it Breaks Club?
  answer: |
    We launch collections per city and you use the Svenir Web App to purchase 
    the package(s) that you want from the city you are in.

    It is mandatory that you are in the location to be able to purchase the 
    BIBC NFTs. You will know what city we will launch in advance so you can prepare yourself accordingly.
- quetion: How do I know what city will come next in the collections?
  answer: |
    We will launch where our community wants us to launch. We have chosen New York City as the first one as 
    it is the GOAT of all the cities. The next cities will depend on where our community wants us to be.
- quetion: How do I purchase the NFTs ?
  answer: |
    You can pay with credit card or with MATIC in case you already have a wallet, and MATIC tokens on it.
- quetion: Is there a token in the Svenir ecosystem?
  answer: |
    Yes. There is a token with multiple purposes inside the Svenir ecosystem. We will let you know when time is right about its relationship with the 
    Before It Breaks Club collections and its utility in general for voting, products and services inside the development of the Svenir ecosystem.
